The idea is along the lines of:

todo:

cas cli tool 'cas'

  cas sync src dst
  
    Compare content of src and dst, like rsync, copy all from src that
        are absent in dst
        
        --delete
            Remove any in dst that are not in src
            
        --dry-run
            Don't really do it
            
        --expiry
            Set expiry on new objects
            
  cas diff src dst
  
    Produce a listing of the differences, as content ids,
    as a description of what a 'cas sync --delete src dst' would do
    +id means add to dst, -id means remove from dst
    
  cas copy ids src dst
  
    Copy specified ids from src to dst
    
        ids often specified as a list of ids in a file, or from stdin
        src usually exists, dst often new
