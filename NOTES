There are a reasonable number of duplicates in my audio tree.

I could write something to eliminate those by creating symlinks.

When replicating to another store duplicates don't matter.

When copying back, it might be worth always checking the local store
before copying from a remote; that way when restoring my redundant audio
files I'd at worst only create a copy, not copy it over a network more than
once.

But ideally I'd just create a link of some kind.

I wonder how hard links will currently work?
